## 🧠 What I Learned and Built

- Practiced **fetching data** from APIs (dummy or sample endpoints).  
- Used **async/await** and **error handling** to manage asynchronous calls.  
- Dynamically updated the **DOM** to show finance metrics, charts, or data.  
- Styled UI with HTML & CSS for clean, professional look.
